We declare that the work we have submitted for Stage G of this assignment and all stages before it is entirely our own work, with the following documented exceptions:

* Methods isTilePlacementWellFormed, isBoardStringWellFormed, areConnectedNeighbours,
  generateDiceRoll, getBasicScore and getAdvancedScore in the original class RailwayInk are 
  used in our skeleton. Part of parameters and return types have been changed to achieve simpler function.

*the ImageView function used in Viewer was taken from a piazza post created by the instructors Ashleigh Johannes and Josh Milthorpe.

* The code in class <Viewer> to draw grids uses an idea suggested by <Olivia Chen>

* The idea of which classes need to be imported to create a test comes from <IsBoardStringWellFormedTest>

        - "dieA.gif" is download from website "http://premium-institute.com/RollingDie.html";
        - "LOGO.png" is download from website "https://www.kisspng.com/png-train-cartoon-train-png-vector-material-276124/download-png.html"
          and mix with pictures in Microsoft word;
        - "round1.png" to "round7.png", "win.png", "lose.png", and "even.png" are purely made using Microsoft word;
