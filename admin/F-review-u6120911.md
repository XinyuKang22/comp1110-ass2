Review Comments:

1. Best features:
    The code has a concise structure. 
2. Documentation:
    The documentations above each methods are good. But the code needs more comments between the lines. 
    i.e. in method <getNearbyGrids>, it will be better to add some explanation for the if-else statement.
3. Program Decomposition:
    The method structure is appropriate. 
    Split a complicated method into several simple methods, making the code more readable.
4. Java Code Conventions:
    Methods and variables are properly named.
    The style is consistent.
5. Error:
    There is no serious problems in current stage, but the exception handling of the code needs to be improved.
